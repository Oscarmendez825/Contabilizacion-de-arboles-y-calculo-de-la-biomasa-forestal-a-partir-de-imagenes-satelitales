# Tree Counting and Biomass Calculation GUI

This folder contains a Python script implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for loading satellite images and using a machine learning model to count trees and calculate biomass.

## Overview

The script provided here is aimed at providing an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the tree counting and biomass calculation model.

## Included Features

1. **Image Loading**: Load an image from your local machine to be processed.
2. **Tree Counting**: Use a machine learning model to count the number of trees in the loaded image.
3. **Biomass Calculation**: Calculate the biomass from the loaded image using the machine learning model.

## Usage

To use this GUI:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the `installer.bat`.
3. Execute the `MyApp.py` script.
4. Use the GUI to load an image and get the tree count and biomass calculation results.

## Usage: Running MyApp.py

To use the GUI and preprocess images, you can use the `MyApp.py` script. This script serves as the main entry point for the GUI.

### Requirements

- Python 3.11
- tkinter
- PIL

### Usage Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `installer.bat`.
3. Execute the following command from the root directory of the project:
   ```
   python MyApp.py
   ```
4. The GUI will open, and you can use it to load an image and get the tree count and biomass calculation results. The results will be displayed in the GUI.
