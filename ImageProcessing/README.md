# Tree Crown Counting Image Processing Filters

This folder contains Python scripts implementing various image processing filters and techniques for preprocessing images intended to be used by a machine learning model for counting tree crowns.

## Overview

The scripts provided here are aimed at enhancing the quality of input images and highlighting relevant features to improve the performance of the tree crown counting model.

## Included Filters

1. **Contrast Enhancement**: Enhance the contrast of images to highlight tree crowns.
2. **Median Filtering**: Apply median filtering for noise reduction and smoothing.
3. **Morphological Filtering**: Utilize morphological operations for noise removal and shape enhancement.
4. **Color Segmentation**: Segment colors to highlight tree regions based on distinctive color features.
5. **Background Removal**: Remove complex and distracting backgrounds to isolate tree crowns.

## Usage

Each filter is implemented in a separate Python script. To use these filters:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the `installer.bat`.
3. Execute the desired script(s) on your input images.
4. Preprocessed images can then be used as input for the tree crown counting model.
