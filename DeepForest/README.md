# DeepForest Crown Tree Detector

This folder contains the implementation and usage of the **pretrained DeepForest crown tree detector model**. Additionally, it includes the implementation of a **crown tree counter**.

## Contents

This folder contains the following:

- **Crown Tree Counter**: The implementation of the crown tree counter.

## Installation

Before using the DeepForest model, you need to install the necessary libraries. Here are the steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the DeepForest directory: `cd DeepForest`
3. Run the installation script: `installation.bat`

The required libraries are: **opencv**, **deepforest**, **numpy**, and **scikit-learn**.

## Usage

To use the DeepForest model for detecting and counting trees in imagery, you can run the `model.py` script directly. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the DeepForest directory: `cd DeepForest`
2. Run the model script: `python model.py`

This will execute the `model.py` script, processes the image, makes predictions, and counts the trees using the crown tree counter.
